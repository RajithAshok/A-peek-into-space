            <p>HD 189733 b is an exoplanet approximately 64.5 light-years (19.8 pc) away from the Solar System in the constellation of Vulpecula. Astronomers in France discovered the planet orbiting the star HD 189733 on October 5, 2005, by observing its transit across the star's face. With a mass 16.2% higher than that of Jupiter and a radius 13.8% greater, HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.5 kilometers per second (152,500 meters per second; 341,100 miles per hour), making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for extraterrestrial life. The closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733 b is a subject of extensive atmospheric examination. Accordingly, scientists have extensively studied the exoplanet's atmosphere with high- and low-resolution instruments, both from the ground and space.[4] As a result, HD 189733 b was the first exoplanet to have its thermal map constructed (possibly to be detected through polarimetry), its overall color determined (deep blue), transit in the X-ray spectrum, and carbon dioxide confirmed in its atmosphere.</p>
